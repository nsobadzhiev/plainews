# Feed recommendations

In order to get you going if you don't have a good idea which publications to follow, here's a list of feeds I like.
If you want to use the whole list, just use the `config.yml` from the root of this repo - it already has them setup.

# Tech

## [Ars Technica](https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index)

Ars Technica needs no introduction for most people. It’s a news website for technology, science and overwhelmingly software and hardware. I like it because of its in-dept analysis, professionalism and wide range of topics. This RSS link I provided here is the general one, but you can also narrow it down and choose one for just a particular topic.

## [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/feed)

Also needs no introduction - Tech crunch is one of the more famous news websites for technology.

## [BBC News](https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml)

Even though I said I’d refrain from traditional news, I wanted to add BBC since it’s so popular, even outside the UK.

## [Entrepreneur](https://entrepreneur.com/latest.rss)

As a startup person, I like articles about entrepreneurship, running companies, and business. This feed contains some nice articles about that. Often times they are also about technology.

## [Paul Graham’s essays](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/feeds/pgessays.rss) 

Also an old school choice. Paul Graham, one of the founders of Y-Combinator, has been famous for his essays for a long time now. I thought they lost popularity in recently years, but once he published his “Founders mode“ article, and I saw how it exploded everywhere on the Internet, I saw I was wrong. If you are interested in the startup scene, it’s a definite recommendation.

## [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/rss) 

Speaking of the Y-Combinator, here’s HackerNews. It’s an aggregator of itself, but they provide an RSS feed - here it is.

## [David Heinemeier Hansson’s essays](https://world.hey.com/dhh/feed.atom)

This might be one not many of you know. David is the founder of 37signals, author of Rework, author and maintainer of Ruby on Rails (plus another 100 things). His credentials and past are really impressive and he often writes articles in his blog. The last ones (as of this writing) got too political for my taste, but other than that, I really enjoy them.

## [Product hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/feed)

If you’re into seeing new products on Product hunt, you can also add them to your RSS reader and get notified whenever there’s something interesting for you.

## Medium

Medium publications have RSS feeds. It’s just https://medium.com/feed/ and then the username you’d like to follow. For instance, mine is https://medium.com/feed/@n.sobadjiev_2847

## Substack

Substack obviously has a dedicated app and website, but if you want to see your favourite Substacks in an RSS reader, you can get them by appending /feed to the Substack you want. Mine would be https://hipstertech.substack.com/feed.
